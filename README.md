##  Data mining is a growing demand on the market as the world is generating data at an increasing pace. R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistical analysis.

This course is the next step for the React full stack web developer wishing to gain a fuller understanding of React development. One of the most powerful features of React is that it follows a radically different method of application development. It moves away from the traditional monolithic approach and re-orients developers to creating in a fully componentized manner. This requires a completely different way of thinking that can be unfamiliar to developers trained in the old ways. This course will help you understand the power behind this new approach and show you how to build componentized apps and sites with reusable functionality. You will learn about the changes in ES6, and how they are important to React development, and also how you can use Babel to use those features in current browsers. You will use JSX to create reusable components and learn how to pass parameters between them to create reactive sites. The course also dives into building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) using isomorphic JavaScript for a more dynamic experience.

After completing this course, you will be able to solve real-world data mining problems.
